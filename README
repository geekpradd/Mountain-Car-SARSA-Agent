For training the agent on Mountain Car, run the following command:
 python mountain_car.py --task [T1/T2] --train 1

 This will generate the plots and the saved weight in the same directory for the task on which you have trained.

 To test the trained policy, simply run 

  python mountain_car.py --task [T1/T2] --train 0

  This will output the average reward over 100 test episodes
